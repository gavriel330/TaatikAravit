###  Transliteration Logic Attribution

**All transliteration logic is derived entirely from:**

**[Mooffie’s Arabic Keyboard](https://geek.co.il/~mooffie/arabic/keyboard/)**  
Originally written as a bookmarklet for converting Hebrew into Arabic text.

This project embeds that logic exactly, with no algorithmic modifications.

### ⚠️ Licensing Status

The original keyboard logic **does not specify any license**, and thus is **not open-source** under standard legal definitions.

As of the time of writing, multiple attempts were made to contact the author to request permission or clarify licensing terms — **but without success**.

Accordingly:

- This extension **must not** be distributed commercially or submitted to the Chrome Web Store
- This extension is intended for **private use only**
- All credit for the core transliteration engine goes to the original author of the bookmarklet
